# Unique-Sum-Pairs-Problem
Hard difficulty problem solved in C++

Problem Statement:
Given an integer vector arrray[] sorted int increasing order of N size and an integer X, find the number of unique pairs that exist
whose abslute sum is exactly X.

Sample Input 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],  X = 7
Sample Output 1: 2
Explanation: (1, 6) and (3, 4) are unique pairs with sum 7

Sample Input 2: [3, 1, 3, 5, 3], X = 6
Sample Output 2: 2
Explanation: (3, 3) and (1, 5) are unique pairs with sum 6

Sample Input 3: [2, 2, 2], X = 4
Sample Output 3: 1
Explanation: (2, 2) is the uniqe pair with sum 4
